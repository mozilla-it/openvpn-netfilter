[openvpn-netfilter]
# This section contains tweakable items that you may / may not need.
# If the defaults from the sample are sufficient, then you can get by
# without any config file for netfilter_openvpn.  However, mozdef and
# iamvpnlibrary will need theirs.

# Path to executables

# Script locking, so all work completes atomically with respect to
# other invocations of this script
# What external lock file to use:
; LOCKPATH = /var/run/openvpn_netfilter.lock
# Number of seconds (integer) per try to lock the file
; LOCKWAITTIME = 2
# Number of times to try to lock the file
; LOCKRETRIESMAX = 10


[testing]
# The 'testing' section contains information for the unit tests.
# A production instance can/should empty this.
#
# A test IP for someone connecting in.
# You want this to be something that would never interfere with your
# openvpn server or test box.  For demo purposes, I leave a Class E
# reserved address here to avoid collisions.

# We also need a username for someone who's valid / would get ACLs.
# As a reminder, this is pulled in via iamvpnlibrary methods.
